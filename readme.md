# ðŸŒ¿Quizzleef Question Manager

A simple Django-based Question Manager application created as part of my Python/Django learning journey. Questions that eventually will be used in different platforms that I haven't decided on yet. Easily managining those questions in a csv file did not sound so that cool enough so I decided to spend several hours learning and building this system instead. It's funny, I guess.

## Features
- Basic question management (CRUD operations)
- Categorize questions
- Search/filter functionality
- Simple Django admin interface
- (Future) Docker integration
- (Future) Take the questions in exam mode
- (Future) AI Integration analizing score and as a study buddy
